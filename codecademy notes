WHAT IS REACT?

- React is a javascript library created by Facebook.


WHY REACT?

- It's fast - handling complex updates while still feeling responsive.
- It's modular - you use small reusable files rather than large, dense files. This helps javascript's maintainability problem.
- It's scalable - large programs that display a lot of data are its best use case.
- It's flexible - it can be used for many things other than web apps.
- It's popular - a lot of companies use it, meaning lots of documentation, and good for getting a job.


INTRO TO JSX

- JavaScript XML is a syntax extension of javascript that provides highly functionable and reusable markup code.
- It is not valid JavaScript, so a web browser can't read it - it must be compiled first.
- It combines JavaScript and HTML.
- It belongs in a JavaScript file.
- It's used to create DOM elements that are then rendered in the React DOM.
- A basic unit of JSX is called a JSX element.
- JSX elements are treated as JavaScript expressions, meaning they can go anywhere JavaScript can go. It can be saved in a variable, passed to a function, stored in an object or array, etc.
- JSX elements can have attributes, just like HTML. It's a name, an equals sign, then a value wrapped in quotes: name="value".
- A single JSX element can have many attributes.
- You can nest elements inside others, <a><h1>for instance</h1></a>.
- If a JSX expression takes up more than one line, you must wrap the whole expression in parenthesis.
- JSX expressions must have exactly one outermost element. If there are multiple, wrap them all in a div.
- To render a JSX element means to make it appear on a screen.
- React relies on two things to render: what content to render, and where to place it on the screen.
- We can create a React root using createRoot() and using its render() method to render JSX.
- The render() method's argument does not need to be JSX, but must evaluate to a JSX expression.
- You can save a JSX expression as a variable, and then pass that to render.
- One special thing about React root's render() is that it only updates elemenets that have changed.
- Updating only the necessary elements is accomplished using React's virtual DOM.


THE VIRTUAL DOM

- React's virtual DOM prevents wasteful DOM manipulation
