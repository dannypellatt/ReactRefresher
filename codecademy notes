----------------------- INTRO TO REACT

- React is a javascript library created by Facebook.

WHY REACT?

- It's fast - handling complex updates while still feeling responsive.
- It's modular - you use small reusable files rather than large, dense files. This helps javascript's maintainability problem.
- It's scalable - large programs that display a lot of data are its best use case.
- It's flexible - it can be used for many things other than web apps.
- It's popular - a lot of companies use it, meaning lots of documentation, and good for getting a job.


----------------------- INTRO TO JSX

- JavaScript XML is a syntax extension of javascript that provides highly functionable and reusable markup code.
- It is not valid JavaScript, so a web browser can't read it - it must be compiled first.
- It combines JavaScript and HTML.
- It belongs in a JavaScript file.
- It's used to create DOM elements that are then rendered in the React DOM.
- A basic unit of JSX is called a JSX element.
- JSX elements are treated as JavaScript expressions, meaning they can go anywhere JavaScript can go. It can be saved in a variable, passed to a function, stored in an object or array, etc.
- JSX elements can have attributes, just like HTML. It's a name, an equals sign, then a value wrapped in quotes: name="value".
- A single JSX element can have many attributes.
- You can nest elements inside others, <a><h1>for instance</h1></a>.
- If a JSX expression takes up more than one line, you must wrap the whole expression in parenthesis.
- JSX expressions must have exactly one outermost element. If there are multiple, wrap them all in a div.
- To render a JSX element means to make it appear on a screen.
- React relies on two things to render: what content to render, and where to place it on the screen.
- We can create a React root using createRoot() and using its render() method to render JSX.
- The render() method's argument does not need to be JSX but must evaluate to a JSX expression.
- You can save a JSX expression as a variable, and then pass that to render.
- One special thing about React root's render() is that it only updates elements that have changed.
- Updating only the necessary elements is accomplished using React's virtual DOM.


----------------------- THE VIRTUAL DOM

- React's virtual DOM prevents wasteful DOM manipulation

THE PROBLEM

- DOM manipulation is at the heart of the modern, interactive web. Unfortunately, it's a lot slower than JavaScript operations.
- The slowness is made worse by the fact that most JS frameworks update the DOM much more than they have to.
- If you have a list of ten items and one item changes, you don't need to update the whole list.
- To address this, React developers invented the Virtual DOM.

THE VIRTUAL DOM

- The DOM (Document Object Model) is a representation of a webpage created by and stored in a user's browser.
- The browser takes HTML, and transforms it into a DOM.
- The DOM is stored as a tree-like structure, best thought of as a tree of nodes representing a web page.
- If a small change happens using a DOM, it's faster to update everything than to work out which bit has changed.
- It's faster still to use a Virtual DOM - a representation of a DOM as a JavaScript object.
- The framework makes a copy of the JavaScript object and, when changes are made, then compares the two copies. This is called diffing.
- It then informs the browser of these changes and only updates the necessary parts.
- Making changes with JavaScript objects is much faster than comparing DOMs.
- Using a Virtual DOM allows browsers to see when no changes need to be made, only repaint certain elements, and groups together the changes needed.
